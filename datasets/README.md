# Datasets

## List of datasets

- `Si2_valence`: Silicon valence band only
- `Si2`: Silicon valence and conduction bands
- `Cu`: copper, metal
- `CrI3`: chromium triiodide, magnetic calculation

## Dataset generation

These files are generated by the respective `creator/run.sh` script in each subdirectory.
The `creator` subdirectory contains all the script and input files for DFT codes
to generate the Wannier input `amn/mmn/eig/...` files.

The Fortran binary (also called unformatted) files are written by QE binaries
which are compiled with

```bash
GNU Fortran (Ubuntu 11.2.0-19ubuntu1) 11.2.0
```

To add a new dataset:

- Create a new subdirectory, e.g. `Si2`
- Put all the input files for the DFT code in the subdirectory `Si2/creator/`
- Create a `run.sh` script in `creator/` which runs the DFT code and generates the `amn/mmn/eig/...` files
- Move the `amn/mmn/eig/...` files to `Si2/`
- (Optional) Create a `README.md` file in `Si2/` which describes the dataset
- (Optional) Add reference results in a subdirectory `Si2/reference/`

Out goal is that the `run.sh` script should be able to reproduce the `amn/mmn/eig/...` files,
on any machine. So we can easily regenerate the dataset if we need to.
