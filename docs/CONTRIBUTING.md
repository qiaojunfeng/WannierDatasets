## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add dataset(s), ideally small (in terms of file size) but still gives physical results.
3. Make sure the original input files are committed, so we can always reproduce the results on different machines.
4. Always `git rebase` your branch on top of the latest `main` branch, so that we can merge your PR without ugly :worried: merge commits. Otherwise, we will rebase explicitly your branch when merging.
5. Create that pull request!
